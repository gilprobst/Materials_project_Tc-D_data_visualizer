A bunch of terribly written and slow python code I wrote years ago to visualize which elements most often appear in materials
with high Tc (Superconducting Transition Temperature) and D (Pugh-Petifor scale). You need a .csv file with the structure mat_id,formula,Tc,D. 
I got the data for this .csv using another script that used the materials project API.
See .pngs for the results I got years ago.
